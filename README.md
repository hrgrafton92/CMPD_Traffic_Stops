# Predicting Charlotte Traffic Stop Outcomes

## Data Source
Data is available at the [Charlotte Data Portal](https://data.charlottenc.gov/datasets/officer-traffic-stops/explore).

## Research Questions
1. Which of the **general attributes** correlate the most with the **outcome of the traffic stop** (i.e. search conducted, verbal warning, written warning, citation issued, no action, arrest).
2. What **driver attributes** (race, ethnicity, gender, age) correlate the most with the **outcome of the traffic stop**?
3. What **officer attributes** (race, gender, years of service) correlate the most with the **outcome of the traffic stop**?

## Steps and Approaches
### Preprocessing/clean the dataset: 
- Check for missing values
- Consistency (spelling, etc.)
- Skewness â†’ normalization
### Identify variables to be used. EDA
### Identify most appropriate models to use
- Multi class prediction. 5 different outcomes.
- Binary. Search conducted or not
- Sklearn fairness metrics
### Analysis
- Naive/Gaussian Bayes
- Decision Tree/Random Forest
- Logistic regression
- Parameter tuning

All modeling efforts can be found within the Preprocessing_and_Modeling folder

### Create Streamlit App
Streamlit app to make the dataset easily accessible for anyone. Preliminary EDA efforts are made available [here](https://share.streamlit.io/hrgrafton92/cmpd_traffic_stops/main/Streamlit/CMPD_Traffic_Stops.py). Source code and files are located in Streamlit folder.

### Create R Shiny App
R Shiny app to make the dataset easily accessible for anyone. Preliminary EDA efforts are made available [here](google.com). (once completed) Source code and files for R Project are located in R_Shiny folder.

### Create Tableau dashboard
Tableau Public dashboard to concisely show EDA on the dataset, while also identifying main trends present within the data. The dashboard can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/harley.grafton2858/viz/CMPDTrafficStops/HomeDashboard)

## Import Endnotes
We realize that by analyzing this dataset, we could shed light on a potentially controversial topic, that is, how the race/ethnicity/gender of the driver/officier can help to predict the outcome of a traffic stop. 

If this is a finding, it should not be used to guide police targeting, but rather to illuminate bias in traffic stops.  Note that being able to predict the outcome of a traffic stop based on race, ethnicity or gender is inherently unethical/discriminatory. Ideally, traffic stop outcomes based on these characteristics should be proportional to the demographic population of the area under observation.  

Regardless of our findings, we would like to be explicit about the fact that none of our findings are causal. Rather they shed light on correlations in the data that may be used to dismantle bias in policing.
